/// Derived from MCWF_Trajectory, this class uses a set of reference state-vectors to project the evolved state vector on
/**
 * The aim is to compare the evolved state against a certain set (eventually, a complete basis) of reference states.
 * This might form a nonorthogonal set, so that we adopt the \ref nonorthogonalformalism covariant-contravariant formalism.
 * 
 * \see This possibility was first developed for our paper Ref. \cite vukics2009cavity
 * 
 * The projections (the elements of the state vector in the given basis – that might not add up to 1 if the basis is incomplete) are streamed
 * in addition to each \link MCWF_Trajectory::stream_v trajectory stream\endlink. The \link MCWF_Trajectory::streamKey_v key\endlink is supplemented accordingly.

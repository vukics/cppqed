* [An introductory talk](https://youtu.be/yunR73LNJ1M) given at GPU Day 2019
* [Video tutorial part 1](https://youtu.be/Ozj4sDNdlmM) â€” How to download, configure and build C++QED, and run the testsuite on a fresh Ubuntu20.04 installation. The commands used in the tutorial can be found in [`helperscripts/cloudScript.sh`](helperscripts/cloudScript.sh). They are as follows:
```
# Starting from fresh Ubuntu 20.04 LTS installation
# Install prerequisites:
sudo apt install libgsl-dev libboost-all-dev libeigen3-dev clang cmake cmake-curses-gui git python3-scipy # ipython3
# Clone repo + submodules:
git clone --recurse-submodules --remote-submodules https://github.com/vukics/cppqed.git; cd cppqed
# Checkout Ubuntu branch: 
git checkout Ubuntu20.04LTS
mkdir build; cd build
# Configure build:
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang++
# Build everything needed for tests:
make -j4 boostTester fewer_scripts compileTests cpypyqed 
# Tests can be run with
# ctest -j4 # from the main build folder
```

C++QED is a C++/Python framework for simulating open quantum dynamics. It allows users to build arbitrarily complex interacting quantum systems from elementary free subsystems and interactions, and simulate their time evolution with a number of available time-evolution drivers.

Earlier, C++QED was located at sourceforge: http://cppqed.sf.net. The (at the moment somewhat outdated) documentation can still be found there.

The plot is from a recent publication related to the photon-blockade breakdown effect. Here are two nice recent related papers where C++QED was used for the simulations:
* [Vukics et al. *Finite-size scaling of the photon-blockade breakdown dissipative quantum phase transition.* Quantum **3**, 150 (2019)](https://doi.org/10.22331/q-2019-06-03-150)
* [Fink et al. *Observation of the Photon-Blockade Breakdown Phase Transition.* Phys. Rev. X **7**, 011012 (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.7.011012)

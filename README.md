* [An introductory talk](https://youtu.be/yunR73LNJ1M) given at GPU Day 2019
* [Video tutorial part 1](https://youtu.be/Ozj4sDNdlmM) â€” How to download, configure and build C++QED, and run the testsuite on a fresh Ubuntu20.04 installation.

C++QED is a C++/Python framework for simulating open quantum dynamics. It allows users to build arbitrarily complex interacting quantum systems from elementary free subsystems and interactions, and simulate their time evolution with a number of available time-evolution drivers.

Earlier, C++QED was located at sourceforge: http://cppqed.sf.net. The (at the moment somewhat outdated) documentation can still be found there.
